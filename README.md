# guitar-search-demo
This is a demo application that I am writing to be used to learn new web technologies. 

Currently using:
web:
- node
- angularJS
- underscoreJS
- bootstrap
- web api service I created to do simple gets/puts to
- jasmine for unit testing

api service: 
- petapoco 
- and more...


Current plans:
- implement Angular Materials
- write e2e tests with Protractor or similar
- allow get/put of specific items
