# guitar-search-demo

***TODO: ADD SETUP STEPS FOR BOTH PROJECTS***

This is a demo application that I am writing to be used to learn new web technologies. I will be continuously adding/removing tools as I learn, so things might look a bit crazy at times!

Currently using:
web:
- grunt
- node
- angularJS
- underscoreJS
- bootstrap
- web api service I created to do simple gets/puts to
- karma for unit testing
- Angular Material

data persistence:
- MongoDB 


api service (GuitarApi): 
Description: simple API service to Get/Put guitars.  Allows searching by Company currently, but will expand to search Company, Make, Description, etc...
- MongoDB with C# driver


Current plans:
- implement Angular Materials
- write e2e tests with Protractor or similar
- allow search for all fields
- Allow Put of new products (guitars) on an Administrator type page
